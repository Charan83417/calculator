# calculator

The above program is a basic calculator application built using Python's Tkinter library, which provides a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit for creating interactive desktop applications.

When you run the program, a window titled "Calculator" will appear. The window contains the following components:

1. Input Fields: There are two input fields labeled "First Number" and "Second Number" where the user can enter the numeric values for performing calculations.

2. Buttons: Four buttons labeled "Add," "Subtract," "Multiply," and "Divide" are provided to perform different arithmetic operations.

3. Result Label: A label displaying the initial text "Result: " is shown, and it will be updated with the result of the chosen operation.

The user can follow these steps to perform calculations:

1. Enter numeric values into the "First Number" and "Second Number" input fields.

2. Choose the desired operation by clicking on the corresponding button:
   - "Add" button will add the two numbers.
   - "Subtract" button will subtract the second number from the first number.
   - "Multiply" button will multiply the two numbers.
   - "Divide" button will divide the first number by the second number.

3. The program will execute the selected operation and display the result below the buttons in the "Result" label.

The GUI remains responsive, allowing the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program. Additionally, the application handles the scenario of dividing by zero and displays an appropriate error message if the user attempts to divide by zero.

Overall, this Tkinter-based calculator provides a simple and user-friendly interface for performing basic arithmetic operations on two numbers.
